# DESCRIPTION:
# This scripts create the soft links needed in the workdir/data
# folder to let MPAF understand where the samples are.
# It may be used in many ways
# 1) Just execute it and it will ask for the relevant information
# 2) It accepts 2 arguments: the input folder (where the samples are) 
#    and the name of the folder where the softlinks will be created.
# 3) Edit the FOLDERIN and FOLDEROUT variables in here to hold the 
#    values of the input folder and the folder where the softlinks will
#    be created. Then, just call the script
